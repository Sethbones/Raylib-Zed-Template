## Raylib Zed Project Template

i got increasingly annoyed in trying to compile a simple project in raylib, so i did this

this is a collection of scripts all built to make using Raylib with the Zed Code Editor much simpler
such as allowing easy updating of raylib, and easy changing of backends
all of which accessible by F4 and F5
### Features
 - Updating Raylib to the latest git version at the push of a button
 - Preparing Desktop Compilation with an interactive script
 - (Soon) preparing android building with a choice of SDK and NDK
### Usage

To set it up 
Press F4 go to Run and press "Update/Prepare Raylib"
After that's done
Press F4 go to Run and press "Prepare Desktop", select your settings, go to C and press F5 and do "Build and Run Desktop"
Enjoy.
